### What is Esprit? ###
Esprit is a php based social networking site, which uses Apache shindig framework for OpenSocial compliance. Esprit has all the essential features like messaging, friend list, send mail, albums , application gallery etc, yet is very simple and straight forward to understand and use. We feel this is one of the more easier reference implementations of the Shindig framework.

**Esprit is currently version 0.9 beta.**
